\begin{abstract}

\underline{\textbf{Abstract.}} Brief and self-contained text. One paragraph (roughly 4--6 sentences) describing the motivation and key results of your project. 

Between abstract and Introduction you must insert the links to your \textbf{github repo} and \textbf{video presentation} of the project.

\end{abstract}

\underline{\textbf{Github repo:}} \href{https://github.com/bizzare-hub/Chest-Xray-alignment-using-STN.git}{https://github.com/bizzare-hub/Chest-Xray-alignment-using-STN.git}\newline

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\underline{\textbf{Introduction.}} A gentle introduction to the topic of your report, deeper explanation of motivation (mentioning some recent related work on your topic). The introduction must end with the phrase \textbf{the main contributions of this report are as follows} and following concise but still very clear list of 2-4 tasks, problems, improvements, replications, experiments (listed as bullet points) that you performed in your project. This is a usual practice to make the contributions explicit to readers and reviewers.

\section{Related work}\label{related_work}

\underline{\textbf{Related work}} Review of old, recent and state-of-the art methods for solving the problem students encounter in their project. At least 4-5 references should be mentioned with a brief discussion of their drawbacks and advantages. We refer to \cite{DataSet}, \cite{XRayDiagnosis}, \cite{SpatialTransform}, \cite{StyleTransfer}

\section{Algorithms and Models}\label{algorithms_and_models}

\underline{\textbf{Algorithms and Models}} and \underline{\textbf{Experiments and Results.}}

Two main sections describing key students' results. All the relevant content should be distributed among these sections based on the topic of project, stated goals, project plan and students' decision. In general, these sections should contain clear experimental setup and a  link to a \textbf{github repo} (again!) with a fully reproducible code. \textbf{Projects without a github repo with a reproducible code will be graded as zero.}

Students have to explicitly describe the algorithms, models, methods, approaches they used for solving their project's problem. Students should explain the motivation for choosing the models, possible benefits and drawbacks of the choice in application to their problem. The used metrics for accessing the quality of the results should also be described.

The section(s) must contain a \textbf{complete description of the datasets} used for experiments with all the required download links. This includes number of features, samples, types of features (categorial, real, pixels, etc.), description of key features, etc. If well-known datasets are used, e.g. MNIST, CIFAR, etc., it is enough to put a link to a dataset (or related paper) without a detailed description.

All the \textbf{preprocessing} and data-handling steps should be presented in these sections. Make sure to answer relevant questions, e.g. the following ones: How data was normalized? How data augmentation was done? How data was cleaned from outliers or anomalies? How the data was splitted for train, test, validation?

All \textbf{training parameters} should be listed. Which methods did you try and with which parameters (e.g. neural network architectures, weight initialization, optimizers, optimizer parameters, number of epochs, iterations, cross validation, exact number of restarts, etc.)?

\section{Experiments and Results}\label{experiments_and_results}

We highly encourage students to additionally present experimental results in a form of \textbf{tables and plots} (e.g. generated images for projects related to image generation, segmented images for project related to segmentation, table with scores for projects related to prediction, etc.). All the experimental results must be properly discussed and explained. If you experience problems with creating tables in \LaTeX, use e.g. \href{https://www.tablesgenerator.com}{this online tool} or any its analog. In Python's \textit{Pandas} library there are also methods to convert \href{https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_latex.html}{\textbf{pd.DataFrame}} to \LaTeX  .

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

\underline{\textbf{Conclusion}} Concise description of experimental results and outcomes, including possible directions for further work.

Filling appendices \ref{appendix-contrib} and  \ref{appendix-checklist} is mandatory. \textbf{Projects with empty or incomplete appendices will be graded as zero.}
