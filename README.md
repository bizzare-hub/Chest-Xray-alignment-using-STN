# Chest X-ray alignment using Spatial Transformer Network

This is the `Python` implementation of the final project on Skoltech university MSc Data Science ML 2023 course "Spatial Transformer Network for Chest X-ray images preprocessing".

Team:

Andrey Galichin\
Evgeny Gurov\
Arkadiy Vladimirov

The repository contains reproducible `PyTorch` and `Pytorch Lightning` code for training and inference of our model which produces **properly aligned Chest X-ray images**. We also provide some examples of our model performance, using Chest X-ray images from [Chest X-ray14](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02315v5.pdf) dataset.
